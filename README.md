This project is a web form that I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. I chose the Spotify application for listening to music as the theme of the form and tried to make the form the same in terms of appearance and functionality.
Functionalities:
HTML: The structure of the form, which includes input fields such as e-mail, password and other necessary information.
CSS: A style sheet that enables responsive form design for a better user experience.
JavaScript: User-side data validation, which ensures that users enter the correct data before submitting the form. Also added SweetAlert confirmation for successful registration.
